### 🔄 Authentication Flow

1. Signup form creates a user based on role (Admin, Instructor, Student)
2. User credentials are stored in the `Users` table, linked to role-specific tables
3. On login, users are routed to their respective dashboards
4. Sessions manage access and restrict routes

---

### 🧠 Dashboard Logic

- **Student:** View and enroll in courses, see grades and attendance
- **Instructor:** View and manage students in assigned courses
- **Admin:** Add instructors, departments, and create new courses
